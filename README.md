**Challenge:** Developing a web application for the ALS Asociation that aims at increasing engagement by providing interactive patient stories, location based event locator, and creating a future plan to increase younger audience to volunteer. As well as providing features like two way connection between patients and volunteers in order to build an active and interactive community. 

Organization: The ALS Association Florida Chapter                     
Website: www.alsafl.org
 

**Mission**

 

The ALS Association leads the fight to treat and cure ALS through global research and nationwide advocacy, while also empowering people with Lou Gehrig’s Disease and their families to live fuller lives by providing them with compassionate care and support. They provide patient programs, advocate on behalf of patients with our government leaders, create awareness of the disease, and fund research. In addition, the Chapter also provides financial support to their statewide multidisciplinary ALS clinics and research facilities, enabling them to increase patient care.

 
 

**Context**

Charities seldom have enough funding in order to meet their mission and often rely on volunteers to fill that gap. The ALS Association is no different – with limited resources, they heavily reply on sourcing and recruiting volunteers to fulfill their mission. While the need to help vulnerable patients grows year after year, the staffing model remains static. Increasing volunteerism for ALS’s care service programs can significantly aid their organization in providing patients with care, equipment, services, and advocacy.

 

Due to COVID, connecting with potential volunteers has become increasingly more difficult. ALS has found that people are most compelled to volunteer when they learn about and connect to patients’ stories. These stories need to be amplified so to gain elevation across our communities and best connect with potential volunteers. As it is not possible to host in person events or sessions, ALS Association needs a way to engage with this ALS population virtually, while still maintaining a personal touch.

 

**Challenge Statement**

How can technology help The ALS Association Florida Chapter increase volunteerism for their programs? As we move to a virtual world, how does The ALS Association continue to compel and drive action within their volunteer community? Consider a platform where potential volunteers feel engaged with the organization and the ALS population they serve in a virtual setting and can easily find all the information they need online, while also enabling The ALS Association Florida Chapter with a way to track volunteer acquisition and promptly engage all types of volunteers (e.g. Care Services, Day of Event, Leadership, and Skill-Based, etc.). Defining types of volunteers will be necessary on this solution. It should provide a gateway of understanding that all people have something to give and the ALS Association provides for that opportunity.

 

**Technology Baseline**

 

As this application will be serving a very wide range of people, the application should be both desktop and mobile friendly (i.e. responsive web app). For the sake of this challenge, you can assume every user will have access to the internet.
